                    <span class="subHead">A 2024 Message from Axxela's Chief Executive</span> <br>    
                    It is my honour to present our 2024 Sustainability Report to you, a reflection of our stewardship and commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainable growth. The report highlights the meaningful progress we have made over the past year, demonstrating our dedication to purposeful advancement that balances business success with positive environmental and social impact. <br>
                    This report is in line with the core requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, with a specific focus on areas that are material to Axxela, our assets, and stakeholders. <br>
                    <span class="subHead">2024 in view</span> <br>
                    At Axxela, we believe that true progress goes beyond energy delivery. It is about creating long-term value through innovative energy solutions, protecting our planet, and driving sustainable growth. The year 2024 was a testament to this belief, marked by significant milestones that reinforce our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) excellence, operational resilience, and strategic expansion. <br>
                    <span class="subHead">Leading with the future in mind</span> <br>
                    We began the year by officially joining the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), a major move towards aligning our operations with globally recognised sustainability principles. This reinforces our commitment to responsible business practices, from human rights and labour standards to environmental stewardship, and anti-corruption efforts. By embracing the Ten Principles of UNGC, we believe that the thematic areas will play a key role in deepening our sustainability story and aligning us with like-minded organisations for meaningful and systemic changes. <br>
                    Axxela also received a Gold medal award in the 2024 EcoVadis Sustainability Rating, placing us in the 97th percentile of evaluated companies globally. This recognition speaks to our relentless pursuit of excellence. Equally important, we celebrated 8 million man-hours with no Lost Time Injury (LTI), a remarkable milestone that underscores our disciplined approach to safety. <br>
                    <span class="subHead">Expanding Our Footprint</span> <br>
                    Our organisation continues to play a pivotal role in enabling the Federal Government’s Decade of Gas Initiative, contributing actively to Nigeria’s transformative agenda aimed at leveraging the country’s abundant natural gas resources for sustainable economic growth. <br>
                    We took Final Investment Decision (FID) for a gas processing plant in Umuseti, Delta State, Nigeria. The project includes a 12 MMSCF/D modular plant, scalable to 50 MMSCF/D, and a 5km interconnection pipeline network, supported by other ancillary infrastructure. The facility will serve as a potential hub for upstream players with fields within a 30km radius to process associated gas. <br>
                    We also completed a 5km pipeline network in Victoria Island connecting Eko Atlantic City to piped natural gas (PNG). The 5km pipeline network traversing from Outer Marina to Kuramo Beach is the first phase of a 72.5km pipeline infrastructure project expected to connect customers from the Five Cowrie River by the Army Officers’ Mess in Bonny Camp, Victoria Island to Lekki. <br>
                    Additionally, our subsidiary company in Rivers State, Central Horizon Gas Company Limited, recorded an additional 5.1km network expansion, thereby extending our South-South operations and promoting reliable energy access. <br>
                    Through these efforts, we are actively shaping a gas-powered future, creating lasting value that resonates across industries, communities, and the nation. Our investments in sustainable infrastructure and cleaner energy solutions have yielded significant results, translating into a 30.50% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our customer operations, while displacing over 734,718 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the period. <br>
                    In 2024, our commitment to society and social impact remained strong. <br>
                    We donated a fully furnished administrative building to the Lagos State Sector Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), supporting its critical mission of saving lives and ensuring safe roads. <br>
                    We completed and donated medical equipment to the Igbapa Primary Health Centre in Sagamu, Ogun State. <br>
                    We provided scholarship opportunities to 100 pupils in Lagos State as part of our annual 'Back to School' initiative, reinforcing our belief in education as a catalyst for the future. <br>
                    In line with our broader push for operational excellence and digital transformation, we introduced a mobile Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system to enhance real-time infrastructure monitoring and enable data-driven decision making. We also launched a one-stop Customer Portal, a digital platform that provides real-time information and value-added benefits for improved customer experience. <br>
                    Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, we successfully closed our ₦15 billion Series 1 Bond Issuance Programme with an oversubscription of ₦16.4 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence in our vision. For the third consecutive year, our financial health was further affirmed with an upward review of ‘A’ with a stable outlook from Agusto & Co., while GCR maintained ‘A-’ with a revised outlook to positive. <br>
                    <span class="subHead">Looking Ahead</span> <br>
                    As we reflect on 2024, we do so with pride in our accomplishments. While our business will keep evolving to meet future dynamics, our mission remains steadfast: to deliver innovative energy solutions that accelerate Nigeria's shift toward becoming a gas-powered economy. Every pipeline we lay, every solution we innovate, and every partnership moves us closer to a future that aligns business success with environmental responsibility. The year ahead presents unparalleled opportunities to deepen this commitment. <br>
                    To the exceptional team at Axxela, our partners, and all stakeholders: I must say a big thank you. Your support has made the journey truly remarkable. A journey powered by an unshakable dedication to People, Planet, and Value.
